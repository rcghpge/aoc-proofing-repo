## Disclaimer  
This repository features a mix of:  
- My own implementations, approaches, and solutions in AoC.  
- Concepts, implementations, and approaches influenced by and from resources and discussions from the AoC community and online sources.  

The focus of this repository is on developing, testing, and refining problem-solving strategies. The intent is to support anyone interested in improving their programming and coding skills as well as for collaboration in the AoC community and larger tech community as a whole.  

Feel free to explore, learn, and contribute! Feedback and suggestions are welcome to make this resource more beneficial for everyone.

## Future Plans  
- Expand solutions for past AoC events in other programming languages to expand the scope in AoC as a learning path for programming and coding. 
- Update and refine scripts to incorporate new techniques.  
- Build a comprehensive proofing library for learning and collaboration.  

Thank you for being part of this shared learning journey!
